## What NoSQL Means
NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and refers to a variety of database technologies that were developed to handle large volumes of data, diverse data types, and flexible schemas unlike traditional relational databases.

## Difference Between SQL and NoSQL
- **SQL** databases are relational, table-based databases, whereas **NoSQL** databases can be document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases.
- SQL databases have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are better suited for complex queries, while NoSQL databases are designed for scalability and flexibility.

## What is ACID
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

## What is Document Storage
Document storage refers to a type of non-relational (NoSQL) database where data is stored in document-like structures (e.g., JSON, BSON). MongoDB is a popular example of a document storage system.

## NoSQL Types
The main types of NoSQL databases include:
- Document databases (e.g., MongoDB)
- Key-value stores (e.g., Redis)
- Wide-column stores (e.g., Cassandra)
- Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j)

## Benefits of a NoSQL Database
- Scalability: Horizontal scaling is easier with NoSQL databases.
- Flexibility: They can store unstructured and semi-structured data.
- Speed: NoSQL can offer faster performance for certain types of operations.

## Querying Information from a NoSQL Database
Queries in NoSQL databases depend on the type but generally involve specifying key-value pairs or using a query language like MongoDB's query language.

## Inserting/Updating/Deleting Information from a NoSQL Database
These operations also depend on the specific NoSQL database but typically involve commands like `insert`, `update`, and `delete`, often with JSON-like syntax.

## How to Use MongoDB
MongoDB is used by defining collections and documents. Operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting documents can be performed using MongoDB's query language.

For detailed examples and documentation, refer to the official [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/).
